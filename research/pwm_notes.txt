Research notes prepared by coach 

use cat /sys/kernel/debug/pwm 
to see the devices and their current pin associations

gpio pinout: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#gpio

explanation of sys interface in the kernel: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.10/driver-api/pwm.html#using-pwms-with-the-sysfs-interface

to see all current associations of the pwm devices to pins
pinctrl |grep -i pwm

to see all alternative functions for each gpio pin:
pinctrl -c bcm2711 funcs 12-13,18-19
pinctrl -c rp1 funcs 12-13,18-19
pinctrl funcs|grep -i pwm

=============================================
this works, possibly only software pwm 
from https://www.luisllamas.es/en/pwm-outputs-raspberry-pi/:
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Pin configuration
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)

# Create a PWM instance with a frequency of 100 Hz
pwm = GPIO.PWM(18, 100)

=============================================
using the sysfs interface:
main sources:
https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/143643/how-can-i-use-dtoverlay-pwm/143644#143644
https://github.com/danjperron/Pi5PWM_HARDWARE/blob/main/python3/pi5PWM.py
https://gist.github.com/Gadgetoid/b92ad3db06ff8c264eef2abf0e09d569

load 4 channel pwm overlay (device drivers)
sudo dtoverlay pwm
(to remove an overlay use dtoverlay -r pwm)

this enables the 4 channel pwm that is PWM0 in the pinctrl output)

use cat /sys/kernel/debug/pwm before and after to see the device added.
it adds the device with address: 1f00098000

use ls -l /sys/class/pwm/

to confirm which pwm device number is associated with the address added by the overlay.
show the second channel for the new device:
echo 2 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip6/export
this creates /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip6/pwm2

echo 10000000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip6/pwm2/period 
echo 5000000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip6/pwm2/duty_cycle 
echo 1 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip6/pwm2/enable 

use to make sure to select function 4 (start from 0, default) for the GPIO18 (pin 12).
pinctrl set 18 a3
