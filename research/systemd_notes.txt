Systemd is the modern init system used in Raspberry Pi OS.

For example, supposed you want to run a Python script located at:
/home/pi/my_script.py


Do these steps in terminal : 
1. create the service file:
/etc/systemd/system/myservice.service

2. enable and start the service:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable myservice.service
sudo systemctl start myservice.servicee

3. Check the status:
sudo systemctl status myservice.service

This setup will ensure that the python script starts automatically everytime the Raspberry Pi boots.
Remember to make that python script executable:
1) add this line at the top:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
2) chmod ug+x myscript.py
4. to debug, can use this command to see the log file:
sudo journalctl -u myservice.service
