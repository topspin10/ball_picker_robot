Systemd is the modern init system used in Raspberry Pi OS.

For example, supposed you want to run a Python script located at:
/home/pi/my_script.py


Do these steps in terminal : 
1. create the service file:
/etc/systemd/system/myservice.service

2. enable and start the service:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable myservice.service
sudo systemctl start myservice.servicee

3. Check the status:
sudo systemctl status myservice.service

This setup will ensure that the python script starts automatically everytime the Raspberry Pi boots.
