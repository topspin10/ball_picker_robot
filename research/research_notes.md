1. [bka](https://github.com/BKaiwalya/Autonomous-Tennis-Ball-Picking-Robot)

Project sponsored by Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG
Development of an autonomous robot for picking tennis balls off a lawn tennis field.

Detection of tennis balls through Computer Vision and Machine Learning (Haar Cascading, CNN).

Traversal of the robot towards the co-ordinate of ball by closed loop locomotion through gyroscope & rotary encoders.

The microcontroller used is ARM Cortex M4 (STM32 Nucleo-64 F446RE): $15

Wireless data transmission to the robot via communication protocols Zigbee and Bluetooth v2.0.

Sensors: Camera, gyroscope, proximity, rotary encoders.

Software development in C: 12.7%, Python 3: 87.3%

3. [dasa](https://github.com/EricDinging/DASA)

We will design and build a small device that will consist of a container for storage and a rotor at the front that will spin balls into the container when detected. The device will maneuver a defined range (borders marked by mini walls) and automatically detect tennis balls using a Raspberry Pixy camera, IR sensor, and two wheel drive, and by running OpenCV libraries on a Raspberry Pi. Once storage has reached maximum capacity, it will return to a defined destination where someone can retrieve the balls. A Nucleo controller and motors will be used to enable movement.
